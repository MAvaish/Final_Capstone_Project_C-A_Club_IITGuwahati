# 🚗 Smart Parking Pricing System
### (Final Capstone Project for Summer Analytics 2025)

✨ TL;DR: This project adjusts parking prices in real-time using traffic, demand, and competition data. No more empty or overcrowded lots!

## 🛠️ What’s Inside
### 1. The Brains (Pricing Models)
Model 1: Basic pricing (more cars = higher price)

Model 2: Smarter pricing (considers traffic, holidays, and vehicle types)

Model 3: Competitive mode (checks nearby lot prices)

## 2. The Tech
Python + Pandas for data crunching

Pathway for real-time updates

Bokeh for pretty graphs

## 3. Key Features
✔ Prices update every 30 mins
✔ Recommends cheaper lots when busy
✔ Visualizes price changes over time

## 🖼️ How It Works
